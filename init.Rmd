So knit - html. To setup git need repository created first? in github, then create project of same name in R with options git.
>>> followed this : https://community.rstudio.com/t/rstudio-git-commit-not-associated-with-github-account/27633/2   TO:  https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html

Then need to stage? files to have them uploaded. 

Next create a web page in github. Followed: Khan academy, https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/web-development-tools/a/hosting-your-website-on-github
>>>  Make sure to name your project exactly “YOUR_USERNAME.github.io”. That tells Github that you’re making a special webpage project

but it looks like you can do it for any repository, GITHUB Docs:
>>>https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site

Then uploaded the rmarkdown html file. Modified the index.html file from the web page created by Khan:

Test project web page
<a href="init.html">r studio markdown : in web page folder</a>
<a href="https://jo-mc.github.io/rmkdwn/init.html">r studio markdown 
: project rmkdwn</a></br>
</br>

ALso uploaded the init.html form the rmkdwn project.

So the local ref for init.html (which I manually drage and dropped into the web page project works - it did take several minutes for the page to work)

The second method via the rmkdwn project does not seem to work. ??

DATA: HG005_sumcount.mpu, /data/rc003/joe/CCS/chinese_trio/pileup_200+
```
chr1 10467 10         1 1  
chr1 10966 5          2 2  
chr1 66218 64         1 3  
```
FROM: 

> grep -o -n '[+]' HG005.mpu | cut -d : -f 1 | uniq -c > HG005_+count.mpu paste HG005_sum.mpu
> HG005_+count.mpu > HG005_sumcount.mpu

R import filtered data from pileup: 

df <- read.table("C:/BIGDATA______TEMPORARY/chinese_trio_pileup_200+/HG005_sumcount.mpu")

> x1 <- c("chr2")

> sub <- df[df$V1 %in% x1,3]

GIVES:

This is correct chr2 has 3690 values. row 3 is the read depth

AND :PLOT:

> y <- df[df$V1 %in% x1,3]

> x <- df[df$V1 %in% x1,2]

> plot(x,y)

**Insert figure from file:**
![chr2 read depth HG005](C:/Users/jolal/OneDrive/Documents\R\rmkdwn2\Rplot_chr2HG005_readdepth.png)

**Insert figure with r code:**

```{r}
df <- read.table("C:/BIGDATA______TEMPORARY/chinese_trio_pileup_200+/HG005_sumcount.mpu")
x1 <- c("chr2")
 y <- df[df$V1 %in% x1,3]
 x <- df[df$V1 %in% x1,2]
 plot(x,y)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Sample
--------------------
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content  as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
